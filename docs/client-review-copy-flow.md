# Client Review Copy Flow

Podcast teams and agencies need a way to share reviewable episodes before final publishing without confusing that step with the final export.

## User Goal

A creator should be able to create a client or team review copy, collect decisions around visible episode quality, and keep the final publish export clean.

## Review Copy Defaults

A review copy should make its status obvious:

- visible review watermark or label
- lower export priority than final publish
- optional timecode overlay
- current captions and audio state
- unresolved warnings summary
- template and preset used

Review copies should be easy to generate from the export readiness screen.

## Feedback Anchors

Feedback should attach to episode moments and visible objects:

- speaker framing
- captions
- b-roll or callout
- title moment
- lower-third
- audio issue
- chapter or metadata issue

The product should avoid generic comment threads that are disconnected from the video timeline.

## Resolution States

Keep review status simple:

- open
- accepted
- rejected
- fixed
- not relevant

Resolved feedback should remain available for context but should not keep blocking the final export.

Review-copy creation, reviewer decisions, and marked fixes should remain visible in `docs/episode-version-history.md` as creator-meaningful milestones, so teams can understand what changed between review rounds without reopening every comment thread.

Unresolved feedback that would affect the chosen export destination should surface in `docs/export-readiness-review.md` Review Copy Warnings.

## Creator Controls

Managing a review copy should feel like sending a focused decision pass, not opening a generic approval tool. The creator should be able to:

- create a review copy from the current episode state without disturbing the final export setup
- choose whether to include watermark, timecode overlay, and unresolved warnings summary
- resend an updated review copy after fixes while preserving prior feedback context
- jump from feedback back to the exact episode moment and return to the review thread without losing place
- reopen the publish checklist after reviewer decisions change what is ready to ship
- stop using an outdated review copy once a newer round replaces it

These controls should keep review copy rounds tied to episode moments, visible export consequences, and the final publish workflow instead of turning review into a separate task board.

## Agency Fit

For teams producing client shows, the flow should preserve:

- client name
- show template
- reviewer list
- final approver
- requested export destination
- date of approval

This information supports repeatable production without making a solo creator do extra project management.

## Maintainer Acceptance Notes

Accept work that helps teams review long-form podcast episodes before final export. Close work that turns review into a generic task board, requires project-management overhead for solo creators, or treats review copies as final publish files.
