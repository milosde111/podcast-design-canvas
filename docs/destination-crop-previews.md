# Destination Crop Previews

Destination crop previews should show creators how the same episode design will look across publishing surfaces before export.

## User Goal

A creator should be able to check whether speakers, captions, logos, thumbnails, and sponsor elements still work when the episode is prepared for different destinations.

## Preview Surfaces

Support previews for:

- wide full episode
- mobile vertical crop
- square social preview
- thumbnail or cover frame
- client review copy
- archive master

The default export path can still prioritize long-form video, but the creator should see when another surface would crop or hide important content.

## Checks

Flag visible issues:

- active speaker is cropped
- captions fall outside safe area
- logo is cut off
- lower-third is unreadable
- sponsor mark conflicts with crop
- title text is too small in thumbnail view

Each issue should link to the affected preview surface and moment.

Destination crop issues that would affect the chosen export destination should surface in `docs/export-readiness-review.md` Readability Warnings and Speaker Framing Warnings.

## Fixes

Offer direct fixes:

- use alternate crop
- move captions for this destination
- simplify thumbnail text
- use safer logo position
- switch layout for cropped output
- export only the long-form master

## Surface States

A creator should be able to tell at a glance which destination surfaces are in good shape and which still need attention, without treating every surface as equally urgent. Each preview surface should carry a clear state:

- ok — content stays inside the safe framing for this surface
- needs attention — a check found a cropped or hidden element
- not targeted — the creator is not publishing to this surface for this episode
- reviewed — the creator checked the surface and accepted how it looks

Keep the controls simple:

- mark which surfaces matter for this episode
- set a surface as not targeted so its checks stop blocking review
- mark a surface reviewed once it looks right
- reopen a surface if the layout or crop changes later

Marking a surface should never alter the long-form master; it only changes which crop previews the creator is actively reviewing. The publishing destination itself is still chosen in `docs/publish-destination-presets.md`, so surface states stay focused on visual framing rather than export settings.

## Maintainer Acceptance Notes

Accept work that helps creators trust destination-specific framing before export. Close work that treats every destination as identical or prioritizes short-form crops over the core long-form episode.
