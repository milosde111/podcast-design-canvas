# Transcript Search Navigation

Transcript search should help creators find important moments in long episodes without scrubbing the timeline manually.

## User Goal

A creator should be able to search names, topics, glossary terms, sponsor mentions, and repeated phrases, then jump directly to the relevant episode moments.

## Relationship To Episode Review

Transcript search should connect to the review surfaces it routes into:

- glossary spellings from `docs/transcript-glossary.md`
- speaker attribution from `docs/speaker-attribution-review.md`
- chapters from `docs/episode-chapter-markers.md`
- captions from `docs/audio-caption-quality-review.md`
- long-form navigation from `docs/long-form-navigation.md`
- clip candidates from `docs/clip-candidate-review.md`
- cross-talk context from `docs/pause-crosstalk-cleanup.md`

## Search Approach

Transcript search is preview first: results should jump to real episode moments with speaker and layout context—not act as a generic text box disconnected from the video.

## Search Inputs

Support searches for:

- exact words
- approved glossary terms
- speaker names
- sponsor names
- chapter titles
- segment names
- corrected caption text

Search should use the reviewed transcript where available, not only the first machine transcript.

## Results

Each result should show:

- timestamp
- speaker
- short surrounding quote
- chapter or segment context
- caption confidence when relevant
- whether the term has been corrected by the glossary

Results should jump to the episode preview with a small lead-in.

## Filters

Useful filters include:

- speaker
- chapter
- segment
- reviewed or unreviewed
- caption issue present
- visual moment present

## Workflow Connections

Search results should stay connected to the workflow that already owns the decision:

- glossary corrections route to `docs/transcript-glossary.md` Application when a repeated term needs one approved spelling
- speaker-name or wrong-voice hits open `docs/speaker-attribution-review.md` Creator Controls or Review States when the result is attached to the wrong speaker
- chapter and segment hits open `docs/episode-chapter-markers.md` Creator Controls or Publish Readiness when a result suggests a weak boundary or title
- preview jumps preserve the viewing context described in `docs/long-form-navigation.md` Playback Continuity instead of resetting the creator's place
- caption-related hits open the relevant step in `docs/audio-caption-quality-review.md` Review Flow when the result reflects an unresolved transcript issue
- pinned transcript moments feed `docs/clip-candidate-review.md` Candidate Signals and Review Cards when a searched line should become a reusable short clip

## Review States

The product should use search-result status to drive navigation and handoff behavior:

- **shown** — display the result with timestamp, speaker, quote, and confidence context
- **jumped** — open the episode preview at the moment with playback continuity preserved
- **handed off** — route the result to the owning review surface for glossary, attribution, chapter, caption, or clip work
- **pinned** — carry the moment into clip-candidate review without treating it as publish-ready
- **dismissed** — hide the result from the current search session without clearing unrelated export-readiness or checklist warnings

Each state should describe what happens in preview and which owning surface still owns the fix—not only the label on the result.

## Creator Controls

From a result, the creator should be able to:

- jump to the moment with the current layout and speaker context
- apply a glossary correction across repeated matches
- send a speaker-label problem into attribution review
- mark a chapter title or boundary for review
- pin the moment as a clip candidate
- send the moment into caption review
- return to the previous search without losing filters

## Review States

Keep search result status simple and creator-facing:

- match — the result points to the right moment and speaker
- needs glossary — the term should use an approved spelling from `docs/transcript-glossary.md`
- needs attribution — the result is attached to the wrong speaker
- needs chapter review — the result suggests a weak chapter boundary or title
- pinned for clip — the creator marked this moment as a clip candidate

These states should appear on search results and in long-form navigation only when they affect the next editing step, not as raw transcript metadata.

## Maintainer Acceptance Notes

Accept work that makes long-form transcript navigation useful for editing, captions, chapters, and visual moments. Close work that treats search as a generic text box disconnected from the episode preview and speaker context, or clears unrelated publish-readiness warnings when a search result is dismissed.
